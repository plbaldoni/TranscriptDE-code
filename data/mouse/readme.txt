# Files in this folder are from the mouse mammary gland RNA-seq experiment
# generated at the WEHI.
# The paired-end experiment contains paired-end RNA-seq samples from
# 9 mice (3 basal, 3 LP, and 3 ML samples).
# The single-end experiment contains single-end RNA-seq samples from
# 12 mice (basal and luminal cells, from virgin, pregnant, and lactating mice
# with 2 replicates each).
