# Investigation of quasi-Poisson variance model for transcript-level quantification counts
# We simulated technical replicates (Poisson variation) and quantified libraries with kallisto (see code.R)
# We then compared the mean-variance relationship of true counts, which should exhibit a relationship of the form
# variance = mean, and the relationship of kallisto's quantification counts (see plot.R)
